# react-native-react-boilerplate

A react-native and react boilerplate.
Build apps targeting web, iOS and Android!

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) 4.x or better
- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for development
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS development (optional)
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/) for Android development (optional)
- [Android Lollipop](https://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/) or better for Android device testing (optional)

## Stack

- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for web app development
- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for native app development
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6+ support
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module loader and bundler
- [Eslint] for better code lint

## TODO
- Add Redux
- Add production build config for webpack
- More...

## Installation

Start by cloning this repo and installing dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xiaobuu/react-native-react-boilerplate.git rnr-kit && cd $_
npm install # or simply npm i
```

## Running

Once dependencies are installed, run the kit with:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start a [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) and React Packager. The dev server will watch your JS files for changes and automatically lint and generate the `index.[platform].js` files expected by your React Native iOS or Android app.

### iOS

Open `ios/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode, build and run the project.

Unlike the app currently generated by `react-native init` this app removes the `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` key to prevent the app from logging an error in Xcode and leading to an App Store rejection. The key may be added back, if desired, but its value must be set to `true` to prevent unexpected rejection during the review process.

### Android

For android development use the following:

```sh
npm run android-setup-port
react-native run-android
```

### Web

For web development with hot reloading use the following:
```
npm run start-web
```

## Testing

As a minimalist seed this project does not introduce a testing framework. Instead it leverages simple static code analysis to help prevent coding mistakes and introduce some good practices for building React Native apps with ES6.

Webpack is configured with a pre-loader to lint the application with ESLint using the Babel parser during app development. And the `npm test` command may be run at anytime to lint source code otherwise. See the `.eslintrc` file to adjust [linter rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) to your liking.

## Bundling

Building the app for distribution.

1. Execute `npm run bundle` to generate the [offline JS bundle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html#using-offline-bundle).
2. For iOS, update `AppDelegate.m` to load from pre-bundled file on disk.
3. Test the application, create an archive and submit to the store.

## Submitting to Store

Please see [Submitting to App Store](http://habd.as/reflecting-on-react-native-development/#submitting-to-app-store) for instructions on iOS. If you have any good Android instructions, please send a PR this way. Good luck and have fun out there!
